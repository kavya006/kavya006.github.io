### About Me

#### Welcome!

Hi, I'm Kavya, a passionate data scientist with a strong foundation in machine learning, particularly time series analysis and NLP. I hold a Master's and Bachelor's degree in Technology (Dual Degree) in Computer Science from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras.

This portfolio showcases my skills and experience in various areas:

* **Machine Learning:** Building and implementing models for tasks like time series forecasting and text summarization.
* **Data Engineering:** Proficient in tools like Pandas, Polars, and PySpark for efficient data manipulation and pipeline development (think *Kedro*!).
* **Software Development:** Strong foundation in Python and experience in building scalable and maintainable code.
* **Problem-solving and Design Thinking:** Enjoy tackling complex challenges and collaborating with stakeholders to develop innovative solutions.
* **MLOps:** Understand the importance of deploying and maintaining machine learning models in production.

Beyond technical skills, I'm a certified SAFe Agilist, bringing agile methodologies to my work. I'm also a novice technical writer on Medium, actively honing my communication skills.

**What sets me apart:**

* **Proven Track Record:** Consistently delivered impactful results during my tenure at IBM. For example, I spearheaded the development of a comprehensive data processing pipeline, leading to significant performance improvements (e.g., reduced runtime by 60-80%).
* **Award-Winning:** My dedication has been recognized through prestigious awards like the IBM Consulting Growth Award and the IBM Spark Award.
* **Ambitious Learner:** Constantly expanding my skillset, evidenced by my participation in hackathons and personal projects (e.g., ASL gesture recognizer app).

I'm eager to leverage my abilities to solve real-world problems and contribute to impactful projects. Feel free to explore my portfolio to learn more about my work and experience! Don't hesitate to contact me for further information or collaboration opportunities.
